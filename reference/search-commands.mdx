description: Complete reference for Vim search and navigation commands
---

Vim provides powerful search capabilities for navigating and finding text in your files. This reference covers all search-related commands and options.

## Basic search

### Forward search

<Accordion title="/ - Search forward">
  Search forward for a pattern from the cursor position.

  ```vim
  /{pattern}<CR>        " Search forward
  /{pattern}/{offset}<CR>  " Search with offset
  /<CR>                 " Repeat last search forward
  ```

  Examples:
  ```vim
  /function             " Find 'function'
  /foo\|bar             " Find 'foo' or 'bar'
  /\<word\>             " Find whole word 'word'
  ```
</Accordion>

### Backward search

<Accordion title="? - Search backward">
  Search backward for a pattern from the cursor position.

  ```vim
  ?{pattern}<CR>        " Search backward
  ?{pattern}?{offset}<CR>  " Search with offset
  ?<CR>                 " Repeat last search backward
  ```

  Examples:
  ```vim
  ?function             " Find 'function' backward
  ?\d\+                 " Find digits backward
  ```
</Accordion>

## Repeat search

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `n` | Repeat search in same direction |
| `N` | Repeat search in opposite direction |

The direction depends on whether you used `/` or `?` for your original search.

## Word search under cursor

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="* - Search word forward">
    Search forward for the word under the cursor.

    ```vim
    *                     " Search forward for word
    2*                    " Jump to 2nd occurrence
    ```

    The search uses word boundaries (`\<word\>`), so it matches whole words only.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="# - Search word backward">
    Search backward for the word under the cursor.

    ```vim
    #                     " Search backward for word
    2#                    " Jump to 2nd occurrence backward
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="g* - Search word forward (partial)">
    Search forward for the word under cursor, but allow partial matches.

    ```vim
    g*                    " Search forward (no word boundaries)
    ```

    Example: If cursor is on "cat", `g*` will match "cat", "cats", "catalog", etc.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="g# - Search word backward (partial)">
    Search backward for the word under cursor, allowing partial matches.

    ```vim
    g#                    " Search backward (no word boundaries)
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Search offsets

Offsets position the cursor relative to the match:

<ParamField path="[num]" type="offset">
  Move [num] lines downward (in column 1)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="+[num]" type="offset">
  Move [num] lines downward (in column 1)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-[num]" type="offset">
  Move [num] lines upward (in column 1)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="e[+num]" type="offset">
  Move [num] characters right of match end
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="e[-num]" type="offset">
  Move [num] characters left of match end
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="s[+num]" type="offset">
  Move [num] characters right of match start
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="s[-num]" type="offset">
  Move [num] characters left of match start
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="b[+num]" type="offset">
  Same as s[+num] (mnemonic: begin)
</ParamField>

### Offset examples

```vim
/pattern/+2           " Two lines below match
/pattern/e            " At end of match
/pattern/e+1          " One character after match end
/pattern/s-2          " Two characters before match start
/pattern/b            " At beginning of match
```

## Character search in line

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="f{char} - Find character forward">
    Move to the next occurrence of {char} in the current line.

    ```vim
    f{char}               " Find next {char}
    2f{char}              " Find 2nd occurrence
    ```

    Example:
    ```vim
    fx                    " Move to next 'x'
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="F{char} - Find character backward">
    Move to the previous occurrence of {char} in the current line.

    ```vim
    F{char}               " Find previous {char}
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="t{char} - Till character forward">
    Move to just before the next occurrence of {char}.

    ```vim
    t{char}               " Till next {char}
    ```

    Example:
    ```vim
    ctx                   " Change till 'x'
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="T{char} - Till character backward">
    Move to just after the previous occurrence of {char}.

    ```vim
    T{char}               " Till previous {char}
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="; and , - Repeat character search">
    Repeat the last f, t, F, or T command.

    ```vim
    ;                     " Repeat in same direction
    ,                     " Repeat in opposite direction
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Search options

### Highlighting

```vim
:set hlsearch         " Highlight all matches
:set nohlsearch       " Don't highlight matches
:nohlsearch           " Clear current highlighting
```

### Incremental search

```vim
:set incsearch        " Show matches as you type
:set noincsearch      " Don't show matches while typing
```

### Wrapping

```vim
:set wrapscan         " Wrap around file ends (default)
:set nowrapscan       " Stop at file ends
```

### Case sensitivity

```vim
:set ignorecase       " Ignore case in searches
:set noignorecase     " Match case exactly
:set smartcase        " Ignore case unless pattern has uppercase
```

<Note>
`smartcase` only works when `ignorecase` is set. If your pattern contains any uppercase letter, the search becomes case-sensitive.
</Note>

## Search range limiting

Limit search to specific line ranges:

```vim
/\%>10l\%<20lpattern  " Match only between lines 10-20
/\%>50cpattern        " Match only after column 50
/\%Vpattern           " Match only in visual selection
```

## Search commands in Ex mode

### Substitute

<Accordion title=":s - Substitute">
  Search and replace text.

  ```vim
  :[range]s/{pattern}/{replacement}/[flags]
  ```

  <ParamField path="range" type="string">
    Line range (e.g., `%` for entire file, `'<,'>` for visual selection)
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="pattern" type="string">
    Regular expression to search for
  </ParamField>

  <ParamField path="replacement" type="string">
    Text to replace with (can include capture groups `\1`, `\2`, etc.)
  </ParamField>

    - `c` - Confirm each substitution
    - `i` - Ignore case
    - `I` - Don't ignore case
    - `n` - Report matches without replacing
    - `e` - Don't show error if pattern not found
  </ParamField>

  Examples:
  ```vim
  :s/foo/bar/           " Replace first 'foo' on current line
  :s/foo/bar/g          " Replace all 'foo' on current line
  :%s/foo/bar/g         " Replace all 'foo' in file
  :%s/foo/bar/gc        " Replace all with confirmation
  :1,10s/foo/bar/g      " Replace in lines 1-10
  ```
</Accordion>

### Global

<Accordion title=":g - Global command">

  :vimgrep /{pattern}/[flags] {files}
  :vim /{pattern}/[flags] {files}
  ```

  Examples:
  ```vim
  :vimgrep /TODO/ **/*.js    " Search in all .js files
  :vimgrep /function/ %      " Search in current file
  :vimgrep /error/ **/*      " Search in all files recursively
  ```

  Navigate results:
  ```vim
  :cnext or :cn         " Next match
  :cprevious or :cp     " Previous match
  :copen                " Open quickfix window

## Special search atoms

### Position atoms

| Atom | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `\<` | Start of word |
| `\>` | End of word |
| `^` | Start of line |
| `$` | End of line |
| `\%^` | Start of file |
| `\%$` | End of file |
| `\%#` | Cursor position |
| `\%V` | Visual area |

### Pattern examples

```vim
/\<vim\>              " Whole word 'vim'
/^function            " 'function' at line start
/);$                  " ');' at line end
/\%^#!/               " Shebang at file start
```

## Clear search highlighting

```vim
:nohlsearch           " Clear highlighting (keep pattern)
:noh                  " Short form
:let @/=""            " Clear search pattern
```

<Note>
`:nohlsearch` only clears highlighting temporarily. The next search or `n` command will re-enable it. Use `:set nohlsearch` to disable highlighting permanently.
</Note>

## Search count

Show match count and current position:

```vim
:set shortmess-=S     " Show search count
```

After searching, you'll see something like `[1/5]` indicating you're on the 1st of 5 matches.

## Pattern last used

The last search pattern is stored in the `/` register:

```vim
:echo @/              " Show last search pattern
:let @/="pattern"     " Set search pattern
```
