---

Visual mode allows you to select text and operate on it. There are three types of visual mode: characterwise, linewise, and blockwise.

## Entering visual mode

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `v` | Start characterwise visual mode |
| `V` | Start linewise visual mode |
| `<C-v>` | Start blockwise (column) visual mode |
| `gv` | Reselect last visual selection |

## Visual mode types

### Characterwise visual mode

Characterwise selection selects individual characters:

```vim
v              " Start characterwise selection
```

Use motion commands to extend the selection. The selection includes all characters from the starting position to the cursor.

### Linewise visual mode

Linewise selection selects entire lines:

```vim
V              " Start linewise selection
```

The selection always includes complete lines, regardless of cursor column position.

### Blockwise visual mode

Blockwise (column) selection selects rectangular blocks of text:

```vim
<C-v>          " Start blockwise selection
```

This is useful for editing columns in tabular data or code.

## Moving in visual mode

Once in visual mode, use any motion command to extend the selection:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` | Move by character/line |
| `w`, `b`, `e` | Move by word |
| `$`, `^`, `0` | Move to line positions |
| `gg`, `G` | Move to file positions |
| `f{char}`, `t{char}` | Find character in line |
| `%` | Jump to matching bracket |
| `/pattern` | Search forward |
| `?pattern` | Search backward |

## Changing visual selection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="o - Move to other end of selection">
    Move the cursor to the opposite end of the visual selection.

    ```vim
    o              " Toggle cursor to other end
    ```

    This is useful for adjusting the selection from either end.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="O - Move to other corner (blockwise)">
    In blockwise visual mode, move to the other corner of the selection.

    ```vim
    O              " Toggle to other corner (blockwise only)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="gv - Reselect last selection">
    Reselect the last visual selection.

    ```vim
    gv             " Reselect last visual area
    ```

    <Note>
    After pasting text with `p` or `P` in visual mode, `gv` will select the pasted text.
    </Note>

## Switching visual mode types

You can switch between visual mode types:

| Command | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `v` | Switch to/from characterwise mode |
| `V` | Switch to/from linewise mode |
| `<C-v>` | Switch to/from blockwise mode |

You can search within a visual selection:

```vim
v              " Start visual mode

Or use the very magic `\%V` atom in patterns:
