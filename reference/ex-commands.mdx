Ex commands are entered on the command-line by typing a colon (`:`) followed by the command name. This reference covers the most commonly used Ex commands.

## Basic syntax

Ex commands follow this general format:

```
:[range]command[!][arguments]
```

- `[range]` - Optional line range (e.g., `1,10` or `%` for entire file)
- `command` - The command name
- `!` - Optional bang modifier for forced execution
- `[arguments]` - Command-specific arguments

## Common Ex commands

| `:write` or `:w` | Write current buffer to file |
| `:quit` or `:q` | Quit current window |
| `:wq` | Write and quit |
| `:edit` or `:e` | Edit a file |
| `:new` | Create new window |
| `:split` or `:sp` | Split window horizontally |
| `:vsplit` or `:vs` | Split window vertically |
| `:tabnew` | Open new tab |

## Search and replace

### Substitute command

The `:substitute` command is used to search and replace text:

```vim
:[range]s/pattern/replacement/[flags]
```

<ParamField path="range" type="string">
  Line range to operate on. Use `%` for entire file, or `'<,'>` for visual selection.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="pattern" type="string">
  Regular expression pattern to search for.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="replacement" type="string">
  Text to replace matches with.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="flags" type="string">
  Modifiers:
  - `g` - Replace all occurrences in line
  - `c` - Confirm each substitution
  - `i` - Ignore case
  - `I` - Don't ignore case
</ParamField>

Examples:
```vim

## Comments

Add comments to Ex commands using double quotes:

## Command-line ranges

You can specify line ranges before commands:

| `?pattern?` | Previous line matching pattern |

Examples:
```vim
:1,10d              " Delete lines 1-10
:.,$y               " Yank from current line to end
:%s/old/new/g       " Substitute in entire file
:g/pattern/d        " Delete all lines matching pattern
```
