## About vimtutor

The Vim tutor is an interactive, hands-on tutorial that teaches you the most basic Vim functionality in about 30 minutes. Instead of reading documentation, you'll learn by doing — editing actual text files using Vim commands.

<Note>
  The tutor assumes no prior knowledge of Vim. If you've never used Vim before, this is the perfect place to start.
</Note>

## Starting vimtutor

The easiest way to learn Vim is through the interactive tutor. Here's how to launch it on different systems:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux/Unix">
    On Unix systems where Vim is properly installed, run:
    
    ```bash
    vimtutor
    ```
    
    For the GUI version:
    
    ```bash
    gvimtutor
    # or
    vimtutor -g
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Windows">
    On Windows, you can find vimtutor in the Start menu:
    
    - Navigate to **Programs > Vim 9.1 > Vim tutor**
    
    Or run from the installation directory:
    
    ```bash
    vimtutor.bat
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="macOS">
    On macOS:
    
    ```bash
    vimtutor
    ```
    
    If you're using MacVim:
    
    ```bash
    gvimtutor
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="OpenVMS">
    On OpenVMS with a proper Vim installation:
    
    ```bash
    @VIM:vimtutor
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Multiple chapters

The vimtutor is provided in two chapters. After completing chapter 1, continue with chapter 2:

```bash
vimtutor -c 2
```

### Translated versions

The tutor is available in multiple languages. Use the two-letter language code:

<CodeGroup>

```bash French
vimtutor fr
```

```bash German
vimtutor de
```

```bash Spanish
vimtutor es
```

```bash Japanese
vimtutor ja
```

```bash Chinese
vimtutor zh
```

</CodeGroup>

## Manual setup

If the `vimtutor` command isn't available, you can set it up manually:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy the tutor file">
    ```bash
    vim --clean -c 'e $VIMRUNTIME/tutor/tutor1' -c 'w! TUTORCOPY' -c 'q'
    ```
    
    This creates a file called `TUTORCOPY` in your current directory.
    
    For a translated version, append the language code:
    
    ```bash
    vim --clean -c 'e $VIMRUNTIME/tutor/tutor1.fr' -c 'w! TUTORCOPY' -c 'q'
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open the copy in Vim">
    ```bash
    vim --clean TUTORCOPY
    ```
    
    The `--clean` flag ensures Vim starts with default settings.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete the tutorial">
    Follow the instructions in the file. Make changes, practice commands, and learn by doing.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Clean up">
    After finishing, delete the copy:
    
    ```bash
    rm TUTORCOPY
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
