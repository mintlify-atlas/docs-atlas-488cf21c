Vim Script is the scripting language used to customize and extend Vim's functionality. It powers your vimrc file, syntax files, plugins, and much more.

## What is Vim Script?

A Vim script is any file that Vim can interpret and execute. This includes:

- `.vim` files containing script code
- Configuration files like `.vimrc` and `.gvimrc`
- Syntax files that define syntax highlighting
- Plugin files that add new features

These scripts can define functions, commands, and settings that customize Vim's behavior to match your workflow.

<Tip>
The correct notation is "Vim script" (or "Vim9 script" for the newer language variant). We use this notation throughout the documentation.
</Tip>

## Vim Script vs Vim9 script

Vim script comes in two flavors:

<CodeGroup>

```vim Legacy Script
" Uses let for variables
let counter = 1

" Requires explicit commands
call search("pattern", "W")

" Leading zeros create octal numbers
let octal = 017  " This is 15 in decimal!
```

```vim Vim9 Script
vim9script

" Uses var for variables
var counter = 1

" Function calls don't need 'call'
search("pattern", "W")

" Leading zeros are just zeros
var decimal = 017  " This is 17
```

</CodeGroup>

This documentation teaches the newer **Vim9 script** syntax, which:

- Looks more like modern languages (JavaScript, TypeScript)
- Executes much faster
- Supports type checking
- Has clearer, more consistent syntax

## Your first Vim script

Your first experience with Vim scripts is likely your vimrc file. When Vim starts, it reads this file and executes the commands inside. You can:

- Set options to your preferred values
- Define custom key mappings
- Load plugins
- Create custom commands

Any colon command (commands starting with `:`, also called Ex commands) can be used in a Vim script.

## Where scripts are loaded from

Vim automatically loads scripts from several locations:

### Configuration files

- **`~/.vimrc`** or **`~/.vim/vimrc`** - Your main configuration file
- **`~/.gvimrc`** - GUI-specific settings (when using gVim)

### Runtime directories

Vim searches for scripts in your runtime path (see `:help 'runtimepath'`):

<Steps>

<Step title="Plugin scripts">
**`~/.vim/plugin/`** - Loaded automatically at startup

Place general-purpose plugins here that should always be available.
</Step>

<Step title="Filetype scripts">
**`~/.vim/ftplugin/`** - Loaded when editing specific file types

Example: `~/.vim/ftplugin/python.vim` loads only for Python files.
</Step>

<Step title="Syntax files">
**`~/.vim/syntax/`** - Define syntax highlighting

Custom syntax definitions for languages or file types.
</Step>

<Step title="Autoload scripts">
**`~/.vim/autoload/`** - Loaded on demand

For better startup performance, functions load only when called.
</Step>

</Steps>

## Vim plugins

A **Vim plugin** is a collection of one or more Vim scripts along with additional resources like:

- Help documentation
- Configuration files
- Supporting data files
- External tool integrations

Plugins add specific features or functionalities to Vim, such as new commands, enhanced capabilities, or integrations with external tools.

## Types of data in Vim Script

Vim Script supports several data types:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Number** | 32 or 64-bit signed integer | `42`, `-123`, `0x1f`, `0o17`, `0b101` |
| **Float** | Floating point number | `3.14`, `1.5e-3` |
| **String** | Text enclosed in quotes | `"hello"`, `'world'` |
| **List** | Ordered sequence of items | `[1, 2, "three"]` |
| **Dictionary** | Key-value pairs | `{'name': 'vim', 'version': 9}` |
| **Funcref** | Reference to a function | `function("MyFunc")` |
| **Blob** | Binary data | `0zFF00ED015DAF` |

## Number formats

Vim Script supports multiple number formats:

<CodeGroup>

```vim Decimal
echo 127        " Standard decimal
```

```vim Hexadecimal
echo 0x7f       " Prefix with 0x
echo 0X7F       " Case insensitive
```

```vim Octal
echo 0o177      " Prefix with 0o
echo 0O177      " Case insensitive
```

```vim Binary
echo 0b1111111  " Prefix with 0b
echo 0B1111111  " Case insensitive
```

</CodeGroup>

All of these represent the decimal number 127. The `echo` command always displays numbers in decimal format.

<Tip>
In Vim9 script, a leading zero doesn't create an octal number (unlike legacy script). Use `0o` explicitly for octal notation.
</Tip>
