title: Marks and jumps
description: Navigate efficiently using Vim's marks and jump list
---

Marks allow you to save cursor positions and jump back to them later, making navigation in large files and across files much more efficient.

## Setting marks

Set a mark at the cursor position:

```vim
m{a-zA-Z}
```

- Lowercase marks `a-z` are local to the current buffer
- Uppercase marks `A-Z` are global and include the filename
- Numbered marks `0-9` are set automatically by viminfo

## Jumping to marks

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Backtick">
    Jump to exact position (column and line):

    ```vim
    `{mark}      " Jump to mark position
    ``           " Jump to position before last jump
    `[           " Jump to start of last changed/yanked text
    `]           " Jump to end of last changed/yanked text
    `<           " Jump to start of last visual selection
    `>           " Jump to end of last visual selection
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Single quote">
    Jump to first non-blank character of line:

    ```vim
    '{mark}      " Jump to mark's line
    ''           " Jump to line before last jump
    '[           " Jump to start line of last changed/yanked text
    ']           " Jump to end line of last changed/yanked text
    '<           " Jump to start line of last visual selection
    '>           " Jump to end line of last visual selection
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Listing marks

View all marks:

```vim
" Show all marks
:marks

" Show specific marks
:marks aB

" Show marks in range
:marks a-z
```

## Deleting marks

Remove marks you no longer need:

```vim
" Delete specific marks
:delmarks a
:delmarks a b c

" Delete marks in range
:delmarks a-z

" Delete all marks for current buffer (except A-Z and 0-9)
:delmarks!
```

## Automatic marks

<Accordion title="Special marks set by Vim">

Vim automatically sets several useful marks:

```vim
`"      " Position when last exiting buffer
`.      " Position of last change
`^      " Position of last insert
`[      " Start of last changed or yanked text
`]      " End of last changed or yanked text
`<      " Start of last visual selection
`>      " End of last visual selection
'(      " Start of current sentence
')      " End of current sentence
'{      " Start of current paragraph
'}      " End of current paragraph
```

These marks update automatically and cannot be set manually.

</Accordion>

## Practical examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Local navigation">
    Use marks for quick navigation within a file:

    ```vim
    " Mark important positions
    ma          " Mark current position as 'a'
    /function<CR>
    mb          " Mark as 'b'
    /class<CR>
    mc          " Mark as 'c'
    
    " Jump between marks
    `a          " Jump to mark a
    `b          " Jump to mark b
    `c          " Jump to mark c
    ```

    Useful mark naming:
    - `m` for "main" or starting point
    - `t` for "top" of section
    - `b` for "bottom" of section
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Cross-file">
    Use uppercase marks to jump between files:

    ```vim
    " In file1.txt
    mA          " Mark position as 'A'
    
    " In file2.txt
    mB          " Mark position as 'B'
    
    " Jump between files
    `A          " Opens file1.txt at mark A
    `B          " Opens file2.txt at mark B
    ```

    Great for:
    - Jumping between related code sections
    - Marking TODOs across files
    - Bookmarking important locations
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Edit and return">
    Mark position before making changes:

    ```vim
    " Mark current position
    ma
    
    " Go elsewhere and make changes
    /function<CR>
    cw new_name<Esc>
    
    " Return to marked position
    `a
    ```

    Or use automatic marks:
    ```vim
    " Make a change
    ciw newword<Esc>
    
    " Jump back to where you were
    ``
    
    " Jump to last change
    `.
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Copy between positions">
    Use marks to specify ranges:

    ```vim
    " Mark start of range
    ma
    
    " Move to end
    /end<CR>
    
    " Yank from mark to current position
    y'a
    
    " Or delete
    d'a
    
    " Or operate on the range
    :'a,.s/old/new/g
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Jump list

Vim maintains a jump list of cursor positions:

<CodeGroup>

```vim Navigate jumps
" Jump to older position
<Ctrl-O>

" Jump to newer position
<Ctrl-I> or <Tab>

" View jump list
:jumps

" Clear jump list
:clearjumps
```

```vim Jump commands
" These create jump list entries:
'       " Jump to mark
`       " Jump to mark
G       " Go to line
/       " Search forward
?       " Search backward
n       " Next search match
N       " Previous search match
%       " Jump to matching bracket
(       " Sentence backward
)       " Sentence forward
{       " Paragraph backward
}       " Paragraph forward
[[      " Section backward
]]      " Section forward
```

</CodeGroup>

## Change list

Navigate through your edit history:

```vim
" Jump to older change position
g;

" Jump to newer change position
g,

" View change list
:changes
```

<Accordion title="Using the change list">

The change list tracks up to 100 positions where you made changes:

```vim
" Make some changes
ciw word1<Esc>
/other<CR>
ciw word2<Esc>

" Jump back through changes
g;          " Jump to 'word2' change
g;          " Jump to 'word1' change

" Jump forward
g,          " Jump to 'word2' change
g,          " Jump to current position
```

Useful for:
- Reviewing recent edits
- Finding where you made a specific change
- Navigating through complex editing sessions

</Accordion>

## Practical workflows

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Code review">
    Mark sections while reviewing code:

    ```vim
    " Mark issues
    mI          " Issue to investigate
    /bug<CR>
    mB          " Bug location
    /todo<CR>
    mT          " TODO item
    
    " Review marks
    :marks IBT
    
    " Jump to each
    `I
    " ... review ...
    `B
    " ... fix ...
    `T
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Refactoring">
    Track related code locations:

    ```vim
    " Mark definition
    mD
    
    " Find usages and mark them
    /usage1<CR>
    mA
    /usage2<CR>
    mB
    
    " Update each location
    `D          " Update definition
    `A          " Update usage 1
    `B          " Update usage 2
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Documentation">
    Navigate between documentation sections:

    ```vim
    " Mark sections
    /^# Introduction<CR>
    mi
    /^# Installation<CR>
    mn
    /^# Usage<CR>
    mu
    
    " Jump between sections
    `i          " Introduction
    `n          " Installation
    `u          " Usage
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Multi-file edits">
    Coordinate changes across files:

    ```vim
    " In config.h
    mC
    
    " In main.c
    mM
    
    " In utils.c
    mU
    
    " Make coordinated changes
    `C          " Update header
    `M          " Update main
    `U          " Update utils
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Advanced techniques

<Accordion title="Preserving marks">

Use the lockmarks command to prevent mark updates:

```vim
" Execute command without updating marks
:lockmarks {command}

" Example: Delete lines without updating '[ and ']
:lockmarks 10,20delete
```

Use keepjumps to avoid updating the jump list:

```vim
" Navigate without affecting jump list
:keepjumps {command}

" Example:
:keepjumps normal gg
```

</Accordion>

## Tips and best practices

<Accordion title="Mark usage tips">

### Choose meaningful mark names
```vim
" Consistent naming helps memory
ma          " Start of section A
mb          " Start of section B
mt          " Top of file
mm          " Main function/section
```

### Use marks with operators
```vim
" Operate from mark to cursor
d`a         " Delete from mark 'a' to cursor
y`b         " Yank from mark 'b' to cursor
=`c         " Format from mark 'c' to cursor
```

### Combine with search
```vim
" Mark before searching
ma
/pattern<CR>
" ... work ...
`a          " Return to start
```

### Use automatic marks
```vim
" Jump to last edit
`.

" Jump to last exit position
`"

" Jump to last visual selection
`<
`>
```

### Map common operations
```vim
" Quick mark setting/jumping
nnoremap <leader>m ma
nnoremap <leader>j `a

" Navigate change list
nnoremap <leader>; g;
nnoremap <leader>, g,
```
