---

Registers are storage locations in Vim where you can store text, macros, and other data. Understanding registers enables powerful editing workflows.

## Types of registers

Vim has ten types of registers:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Unnamed">
    The unnamed register `""` contains:
    - Text from the last delete, change, or yank
    - Acts as the default for put operations

    ```vim
    " Yank without specifying register (goes to "")
    yy
    
    " Put from unnamed register
    p
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Numbered">
    Numbered registers `"0` through `"9`:
    - `"0` contains the last yank
    - `"1` through `"9` contain last 9 deletes

    ```vim
    " Access last yank
    "0p
    
    " Access previous delete
    "1p
    
    " Cycle through delete history
    "1p    " First deleted text
    u      " Undo
    "2p    " Second deleted text
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Named">
    Named registers `"a` through `"z`:
    - Explicitly store text for later use
    - Uppercase appends to register

    ```vim
    " Yank to register 'a'
    "ayy
    
    " Put from register 'a'
    "ap
    
    " Append to register 'a'
    "Ayy
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Special">
    Special registers:
    - `"_` - Black hole (delete without saving)
    - `"+` - System clipboard
    - `"*` - X11 primary selection
    - `".` - Last inserted text
    - `"%` - Current filename
    - `":` - Last Ex command
    - `"/` - Last search pattern

    ```vim
    " Delete without affecting registers
    "_dd
    
    " Yank to system clipboard
    "+yy
    
    " Paste from system clipboard
    "+p
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Viewing registers

Inspect register contents:

```vim
" Show all registers
:reg

" Show specific registers
:reg a b c

" Show numbered registers
:reg 0-9
```

## Basic operations

<CodeGroup>

```vim Yanking to registers
" Yank line to register a
"ayy

" Yank word to register b
"byw

" Yank visual selection to register c
"cy

" Yank to clipboard
"+yy
```

```vim Putting from registers
" Put from register a after cursor
"ap

" Put from register a before cursor
"aP

" Put from last yank
"0p

" Put from clipboard
"+p
```

```vim Deleting to registers
" Delete line to register a
"add

" Delete word to register b
"bdw

" Delete without saving
"_dd
```

</CodeGroup>

## Practical examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Swap text">
    Use registers to swap text blocks:

    ```vim
    " Method 1: Using two registers
    "ayy        " Yank first line to 'a'
    j          " Move down
    "byy        " Yank second line to 'b'
    k          " Move up
    "bp         " Put 'b'
    j          " Move down
    "ap         " Put 'a'
    
    " Method 2: Using delete and put
    dd         " Delete first line
    p          " Put after second line
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Collect text">
    Collect multiple lines into one register:

    ```vim
    " Start with empty register
    qaq        " Clear register 'a'
    
    " Collect lines (uppercase appends)
    "Ayy        " Append first line
    /pattern<CR>
    "Ayy        " Append found line
    /another<CR>
    "Ayy        " Append another line
    
    " Put all collected lines
    "ap
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Multiple clipboards">
    Use named registers as multiple clipboards:

    ```vim
    " Copy different sections
    "ayy        " Copy to 'a'
    /function<CR>
    "byy        " Copy to 'b'
    /import<CR>
    "cyy        " Copy to 'c'
    
    " Paste where needed
    "ap         " Paste from 'a'
    "bp         " Paste from 'b'
    "cp         " Paste from 'c'
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Save patterns">
    Store and reuse search patterns:

    ```vim
    " Save a search pattern
    :let @/ = 'pattern'
    
    " Perform the search
    n
    
    " Save for later
    :let @a = @/
    
    " Restore later
    :let @/ = @a
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Clipboard integration

<Accordion title="Using system clipboard">

Work with the system clipboard:

```vim
" Check if clipboard is available
:echo has('clipboard')

" Yank to clipboard
"+yy
"+y{motion}
{Visual}"+y

" Put from clipboard
"+p
"+P

" Use clipboard as default
set clipboard=unnamedplus    " Linux
set clipboard=unnamed        " macOS
```

Use the `*` register for X11 primary selection:
```vim
" Yank to primary selection
"*yy

" Put from primary selection (middle mouse button)
"*p
```

</Accordion>

## Expression register

The expression register `"=` evaluates expressions:

<CodeGroup>

```vim Insert calculations
" In insert mode
<Ctrl-R>=2+2<CR>      " Inserts: 4
<Ctrl-R>=system('date')<CR>
```

```vim Paste expression results
" In normal mode
"=2*10<CR>p           " Puts: 20
"=expand('%')<CR>p    " Puts: current filename
```

```vim Use in commands
" Search for current word
:let @/=expand('<cword>')

" Replace with expression
:s/old/\=@a/g         " Replace with register 'a' contents
```

</CodeGroup>

## Reading registers in commands

Access register contents in Ex commands:

```vim
" Read register into command line
<Ctrl-R>a              " Insert register 'a' contents
<Ctrl-R><Ctrl-R>a      " Insert literally

" Use in substitution
:s/pattern/<Ctrl-R>a/g

" Use in command
:echo @a               " Display register 'a'
:let text = @a         " Assign to variable
```

## Setting registers

Set register contents programmatically:

```vim
" Set register in command line
:let @a = 'text'
:let @a = @a . ' more'    " Append

" Set from visual selection
:let @a = @*              " Copy from selection

" Set from expression
:let @a = strftime('%Y-%m-%d')

" Clear register
:let @a = ''
```

## Special use cases

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Last command">
    The `:` register stores the last Ex command:

    ```vim
    " Show last command
    :echo @:
    
    " Repeat last command
    @:
    
    " Edit and execute
    :let @a = @:
    " Edit @a
    :@a
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Last search">
    The `/` register stores the last search pattern:

    ```vim
    " Show last search
    :echo @/
    
    " Change search pattern
    :let @/ = 'newpattern'
    
    " Clear search highlighting
    :let @/ = ''
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Current file">
    The `%` register contains the current filename:

    ```vim
    " Insert filename
    <Ctrl-R>%
    
    " Use in command
    :echo @%
    
    " Get full path
    :echo expand(@%)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Last inserted">
    The `.` register contains last inserted text:

    ```vim
    " Repeat last insertion
    ".p
    
    " View what was inserted
    :echo @.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Tips and tricks

<Accordion title="Register best practices">

### Protect your yanks
```vim
" Delete without affecting unnamed register
"_dd

" Use black hole register
"_d{motion}
```

### Quick access to yanked text
```vim
" Last yank is always in register 0
"0p          " Even after deleting
```

### Build complex text
```vim
" Start fresh
:let @a = ''

" Build up text
:let @a .= 'line1\n'
:let @a .= 'line2\n'

" Use it
"ap
```

### Map register operations
```vim
" Quick access to specific registers
nnoremap <leader>a "ap
nnoremap <leader>b "bp

" Copy to clipboard
nnoremap <leader>y "+y
nnoremap <leader>p "+p
```
