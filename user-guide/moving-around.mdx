# Navigation commands

Efficient navigation is key to productive Vim editing. This guide covers all the ways you can move around in your files.

## Character movement

The basic movement keys are:

```
     k
   h   l
     j
```

| Key | Movement |
|-----|----------|
| `h` | Left |
| `j` | Down |
| `k` | Up |
| `l` | Right |

<Note>
  These keys are on the home row of your keyboard, making them faster to use than arrow keys.
</Note>

<Tip>
  You can also use arrow keys, but using `hjkl` keeps your hands on the home row and is much faster once you're used to it.
</Tip>

## Word movement

Move by words for faster navigation:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Forward">
    | Command | Movement |
    |---------|----------|
    | `w` | Forward to start of next word |
    | `W` | Forward to start of next WORD (space-separated) |
    | `e` | Forward to end of word |
    | `E` | Forward to end of WORD |
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Backward">
    | Command | Movement |
    |---------|----------|
    | `b` | Backward to start of previous word |
    | `B` | Backward to start of previous WORD |
    | `ge` | Backward to end of previous word |
    | `gE` | Backward to end of previous WORD |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Word vs WORD

- A **word** ends at non-word characters like `.`, `-`, `)`
- A **WORD** ends only at whitespace

Example:
```
This is-a line, with special/separated/words (and some more).
     w w w  w    w      w         w     w   w    w    w
     W W W  W    W                            W         W
```

<Note>
  Use lowercase commands (`w`, `b`, `e`) for programming. Use uppercase (`W`, `B`, `E`) for prose.
</Note>

## Line movement

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Start/end">
    | Command | Position |
    |---------|----------|
    | `0` | Start of line (column 0) |
    | `^` | First non-blank character |
    | `$` | End of line |
    | `g_` | Last non-blank character |
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="With count">
    Add a count to move to end of different line:
    ```vim
    1$    " End of current line
    2$    " End of next line
    3$    " End of line after that
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Character search

Find characters within a line:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Find">
    Search forward for a character:
    ```vim
    fx    " Find next 'x'
    3fx   " Find third 'x'
    ```
    
    Search backward:
    ```vim
    Fx    " Find previous 'x'
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Till">
    Move until (before) a character:
    ```vim
    tx    " Move to just before next 'x'
    Tx    " Move to just after previous 'x'
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Repeat">
    | Command | Action |
    |---------|--------|
    | `;` | Repeat last f, t, F, or T |
    | `,` | Repeat in opposite direction |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Example:
```vim
To err is human.  To really foul up you need a computer.
   fh              fy
   ↓               ↓
To err is human.  To really foul up you need a computer.
```

## Line jumps

        ↔     ↔
```

## Current position

Find where you are:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Show position">
    ```vim
    Ctrl-G    " Show file info and position
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    "usr_03.txt" line 233 of 650 --35%-- col 45-52
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Line numbers">
    ```vim

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Marks

Bookmark positions in your file:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set a mark">
    ```vim
    ma    " Set mark 'a' at cursor position
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Jump to mark">

  <Step title="List marks">
    ```vim
    :marks    " Show all marks
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Special marks">

    Ctrl-I    " Jump to newer position
    :jumps    " Show jump list
    ```
  </Tab>

## Combining movements

Use counts with movements:

```vim
3w     " Move forward 3 words
5j     " Move down 5 lines
2f{    " Find second '{'
10l    " Move 10 characters right
```

<Note>
  Most navigation commands accept a count. This makes movement very efficient.
