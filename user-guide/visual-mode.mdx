# Visual mode

Visual mode lets you select text and then operate on it. This is more intuitive than operator-motion for many operations.

## Starting Visual mode

There are three types of Visual mode:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Character-wise">
    Select individual characters:
    ```vim
    v    " Start character-wise visual mode
    ```
    Move the cursor to select text character by character.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Line-wise">
    Select entire lines:
    ```vim
    V    " Start line-wise visual mode
    ```
    Selected text always includes whole lines.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Block-wise">
    Select rectangular blocks:
    ```vim
    Ctrl-V    " Start block-wise visual mode
    ```
    Select columns of text across multiple lines.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  Press `Esc` to exit Visual mode without doing anything.
</Note>

## Basic Visual mode workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start selection">
    Press `v` to start Visual mode
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select text">
    Use movement commands to extend selection:
    ```vim
    w     " Select to next word
    $     " Select to end of line
    3j    " Select 3 lines down
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Operate on selection">
    Type an operator:
    ```vim
    d     " Delete selection
    y     " Yank (copy) selection
    c     " Change selection
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Selecting text

### Character-wise selection

Example workflow:

```vim
This is an examination sample of visual mode
           ^^^^^^^^^^^
           
v          " Start visual mode
e          " Select to end of word
l          " Include one more character
l
l
l
d          " Delete selection
```

Result:
```
This is an example of visual mode
```

<Tip>
  You can immediately see what you're about to operate on, making Visual mode very intuitive.
</Tip>

### Line-wise selection

Select complete lines:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start">
    ```vim
    V    " Start line-wise visual mode
    ```
    The entire current line is highlighted.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Extend">
    ```vim
    j    " Include next line
    2j   " Include 2 more lines
    k    " Exclude last line
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Operate">
    ```vim
    d    " Delete all selected lines
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Block-wise selection

Select rectangular regions:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic selection">
    Example table:
    ```
    name        Q1    Q2    Q3
    pierre      123   455   234
    john        0     90    39
    steve       392   63    334
    ```
    
    To select the Q2 column:
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Position">
        Move cursor to 'Q' in "Q2"
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Start block">
        ```vim
        Ctrl-V
        ```
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Select down and right">
        ```vim
        3j    " Move down 3 lines
        w     " Move to end of column
        ```
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Delete">
        ```vim
        d     " Delete column
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Special $ behavior">
    When you use `$` in block mode:
    ```vim
    Ctrl-V
    3j     " Select 3 lines down
    $      " Extend to end of each line
    ```
    All lines extend to their end, even if different lengths.

## Shifting blocks

Indent or unindent:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Indent">
    ```vim
    v        " Select text
    >        " Indent right
    ```

    ```vim
    v3j>     " Select 3 lines and indent
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Unindent">
    ```vim
    v
    <        " Indent left
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Repeat">
    After shifting, reselect and repeat:
    ```vim
    gv       " Reselect
    >        " Indent again
    ```
    
    Or use dot command:
    ```vim
    .        " Repeat last change
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  Set `shiftwidth` to control indent size:

</Tip>

## Joining lines

Join selected lines:

```vim
V        " Select lines
3j       " Select 3 more
J        " Join into one line
```

Or without changing spaces:
```vim
gJ       " Join without modifying whitespace
```

## Visual mode tricks

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Search in selection">
    After selecting text:
    ```vim
    :s/old/new/g     " Replace in selection
    ```
    Vim automatically adds `'<,'>` range.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Sort selection">
    ```vim
    v
    3j
    :sort            " Sort selected lines
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Execute on selection">
    ```vim
    v
    3j
    :normal A;       " Append ';' to each line
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Count with Visual mode

Count selected items:

```vim
v        " Select text
3j       " Select some lines
g Ctrl-G " Show count
```

Output:
```
Selected 4 of 100 Lines; 50 of 500 Words; 300 of 3000 Bytes
```

<Note>
  `g Ctrl-G` in normal mode shows position. In Visual mode, it counts selection.
</Note>
