# Text editing operations

Vim's editing power comes from combining operators with motions and text objects. This creates a language for text manipulation.

## Operators and motions

An operator performs an action on text. A motion defines the text to operate on.

### The operator-motion pattern

```
operator + motion = action
```

Examples:
```vim
dw    " delete word
d$    " delete to end of line
c2w   " change two words
y5j   " yank 5 lines down
```

<Note>
  This composability is what makes Vim so powerful. Learn a few operators and motions, and you can combine them in countless ways.
</Note>

## Delete operator

The `d` operator deletes text:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="With motions">
    | Command | Action |
    |---------|--------|
    | `dw` | Delete word |
    | `d2w` | Delete 2 words |
    | `d$` | Delete to end of line |
    | `d0` | Delete to start of line |
    | `dG` | Delete to end of file |
    | `dgg` | Delete to start of file |
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Shortcuts">
    | Command | Equivalent | Action |
    |---------|------------|--------|
    | `dd` | `d_` | Delete line |
    | `D` | `d$` | Delete to end of line |
    | `x` | `dl` | Delete character |
    | `X` | `dh` | Delete character before cursor |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  Doubling an operator makes it act on the whole line. So `dd` deletes a line, `yy` yanks a line, etc.
</Tip>

## Change operator

The `c` operator deletes and enters Insert mode:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic changes">
    ```vim
    cw    " Change word
    c$    " Change to end of line
    c2w   " Change two words
    cG    " Change to end of file
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Shortcuts">
    | Command | Equivalent | Action |
    |---------|------------|--------|
    | `cc` | `c_` | Change entire line |
    | `C` | `c$` | Change to end of line |
    | `s` | `cl` | Substitute character |
    | `S` | `cc` | Substitute line |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Change example

<Steps>
  <Step title="Position cursor">
    Place cursor at start of word to change:
    ```
    To err is human
       ↑
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Change text">
    Type `c2w` to change two words:
    ```
    To err is human
       ----
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Type new text">
    Type replacement text:
    ```
    To be human
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Replace

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Single character">
    Replace character under cursor:
    ```vim
    rx    " Replace with 'x'
    5rx   " Replace 5 characters with 'x'
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Replace mode">
    Enter Replace mode:
    ```vim
    R     " Replace mode (like overwrite)
    ```
    Type new text and it replaces existing characters.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Yank (copy) operator

The `y` operator copies text:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic yank">
    ```vim
    yw    " Yank word
    y$    " Yank to end of line
    yy    " Yank entire line
    Y     " Yank line (same as yy)
    y2w   " Yank two words
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Put (paste)">
    ```vim
    p     " Put after cursor/below line
    P     " Put before cursor/above line
    3p    " Put 3 times
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  What you yank goes into a register. By default, it's also copied when you delete or change text.
</Note>

## Text objects

Text objects represent semantic chunks of text:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Word objects">
    | Command | Selection |
    |---------|----------|
    | `iw` | Inner word |
    | `aw` | A word (includes surrounding space) |
    | `iW` | Inner WORD |
    | `aW` | A WORD |
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Sentence objects">
    | Command | Selection |
    |---------|----------|
    | `is` | Inner sentence |
    | `as` | A sentence (includes trailing space) |
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Paragraph objects">
    | Command | Selection |
    |---------|----------|
    | `ip` | Inner paragraph |
    | `ap` | A paragraph (includes trailing newline) |
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Bracket objects">
    | Command | Selection |
    |---------|----------|
    | `i(` or `i)` or `ib` | Inside parentheses |
    | `a(` or `a)` or `ab` | Around parentheses |
    | `i{` or `i}` or `iB` | Inside braces |
    | `a{` or `a}` or `aB` | Around braces |
    | `i[` or `i]` | Inside brackets |
    | `a[` or `a]` | Around brackets |
    | `i<` or `i>` | Inside angle brackets |
    | `a<` or `a>` | Around angle brackets |
    | `it` | Inside tag (HTML/XML) |
    | `at` | Around tag |
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Quote objects">
    | Command | Selection |
    |---------|----------|
    | `i'` | Inside single quotes |
    | `a'` | Around single quotes |
    | `i"` | Inside double quotes |
    | `a"` | Around double quotes |
    | `i\`` | Inside backticks |
    | `a\`` | Around backticks |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Text object examples

```vim
diw   " Delete inner word (cursor can be anywhere in word)
daw   " Delete a word (includes space)
ci(   " Change inside parentheses
da{   " Delete around braces (including braces)
yis   " Yank inner sentence
vi"   " Visually select inside quotes
```

<Tip>
  Use `i` (inner) to work on content without delimiters. Use `a` (around) to include delimiters.
</Tip>

## The dot command

Repeat the last change:

```vim
.    " Repeat last change
```

Example workflow:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Make a change">
    ```vim
    ciwHello<Esc>    " Change word to "Hello"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Move to next location">
    ```vim
    w    " Move to next word
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Repeat">
    ```vim
    .    " Repeat the change
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  The dot command is incredibly powerful. Structure your edits to be repeatable with `.`
</Note>

## Case changes

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Visual mode">
    Select text, then:
    ```vim
    ~     " Toggle case
    U     " Make uppercase
    u     " Make lowercase
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Operator mode">
    | Command | Action |
    |---------|--------|
    | `gU{motion}` | Uppercase |
    | `gu{motion}` | Lowercase |
    | `g~{motion}` | Toggle case |
    | `gUU` or `gUgU` | Uppercase line |
    | `guu` or `gugu` | Lowercase line |
    | `g~~` or `g~g~` | Toggle case line |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Examples:
```vim
gUw        " Uppercase word

g~iw       " Toggle case of inner word
viwU       " Visually select word and uppercase
```

## Formatting

    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Join lines">
    ```vim
    J     " Join current line with next
    3J    " Join 3 lines
    gJ    " Join without adding space
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Indent">
    ```vim
    >>    " Indent line
    <<    " Unindent line
    ==    " Auto-indent line

    Swap two lines:
    ```vim
    ddp   " Delete line and put below

</Tabs>

## Registers

Vim stores deleted and yanked text in registers:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Named registers">
    Use a-z for named storage:
    ```vim
    "ayy     " Yank line to register a
    "ap      " Put from register a
    "bdiw    " Delete word to register b
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Special registers">
    | Register | Content |
    |----------|----------|
    | `""` | Unnamed (last delete/yank) |
    | `"0` | Last yank |
    | `"1-9` | Last deletes (1=most recent) |
    | `"-` | Last small delete |
    | `"+` | System clipboard |
    | `"*` | Selection clipboard |
    | `".` | Last inserted text |
    | `"%` | Current file name |
    | `":` | Last command |
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="View registers">
    ```vim
    :registers    " Show all registers
    :reg a b c    " Show specific registers
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Increment/decrement numbers

```vim
Ctrl-A    " Increment number under cursor
Ctrl-X    " Decrement number under cursor
5Ctrl-A   " Add 5 to number
```

<Tip>
  Use visual block mode with `Ctrl-A` to create sequences of numbers.
