# File management

Vim provides powerful features for working with files, including editing multiple files, switching between them, and managing file operations.

## Opening files

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="From command line">
    Open Vim with one or more files:
    ```bash
    vim file.txt
    vim file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
    vim *.txt
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="From within Vim">
    ```vim
    :edit file.txt       " Open file
    :e file.txt          " Shorthand
    :edit!               " Reload current file
    :edit .              " File browser (netrw)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  If you have unsaved changes, Vim will warn you. Use `:edit!` to discard changes and reload.
</Note>

## Saving files

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Write">
    ```vim
    :write               " Save current file
    :w                   " Shorthand
    :w newfile.txt       " Save as newfile.txt
    :w!                  " Force write (override readonly)
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Save range">
    Write only part of a file:
    ```vim
    :10,20w file.txt     " Write lines 10-20
    :.,$w file.txt       " Write from cursor to end
    :'<,'>w file.txt     " Write visual selection
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Append">
    Append to existing file:
    ```vim
    :w >> logfile.txt    " Append to file
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Quitting

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Basic">
    | Command | Action |
    |---------|--------|
    | `:q` | Quit (warns if unsaved) |
    | `:q!` | Quit without saving |
    | `:wq` | Write and quit |
    | `ZZ` | Write (if changed) and quit |
    | `ZQ` | Quit without checking changes |
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Multiple files">
    ```vim
    :qa              " Quit all windows
    :qa!             " Quit all, discard changes
    :wqa             " Write all and quit
    :wall            " Write all changed files
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Working with multiple files

### The argument list

Files specified when starting Vim form the argument list:

<Steps>
  <Step title="View argument list">
    ```vim
    :args
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    [file1.txt] file2.txt file3.txt
    ```
    Brackets show current file.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate files">
    | Command | Action |
    |---------|--------|
    | `:next` | Edit next file |
    | `:n` | Shorthand for `:next` |
    | `:previous` | Edit previous file |
    | `:prev` | Shorthand |
    | `:first` | Edit first file |
    | `:last` | Edit last file |
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Write and move">
    ```vim
    :wnext           " Save and edit next
    :wn              " Shorthand
    :wprevious       " Save and edit previous
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Use `:next!` to move to next file without saving changes.
</Tip>

### Redefining the argument list

```vim
:args *.txt              " Set args to all .txt files
:args file1 file2        " Set specific files
:args `grep -l word *`   " Set to files containing "word"
```

## The alternate file

Vim remembers the previous file you edited:

```vim
Ctrl-^    " Switch to alternate file
:e #      " Edit alternate file
```

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Example workflow">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Edit first file">
        ```vim
        :e file1.txt
        ```
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Edit second file">
        ```vim
        :e file2.txt
        ```
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Toggle between files">
        ```vim
        Ctrl-^    " Back to file1.txt
        Ctrl-^    " Back to file2.txt
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Special marks">
    When switching files:
    ```vim
    '"    " Jump to position where you left file
    '.    " Jump to position of last change
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## File explorer (netrw)

Vim includes a built-in file browser:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Open explorer">
    ```vim
    :edit .              " Open current directory
    :Explore             " Open file explorer
    :E                   " Shorthand
    :Sexplore            " Open in split
    :Vexplore            " Open in vertical split
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Navigation">
    In the explorer:
    
    | Key | Action |
    |-----|--------|
    | `Enter` | Open file/directory |
    | `-` | Go up directory |
    | `i` | Cycle through view styles |
    | `s` | Change sort order |
    | `r` | Reverse sort order |
    | `D` | Delete file |
    | `R` | Rename file |
    | `%` | Create new file |
    | `d` | Create new directory |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Reading and inserting files

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Read file">
    Insert file contents:
    ```vim
    :read file.txt       " Insert below cursor
    :r file.txt          " Shorthand
    :0r file.txt         " Insert at top
    :$r file.txt         " Insert at end
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Read command output">
    Insert command output:
    ```vim
    :read !ls            " Insert directory listing
    :r !date             " Insert current date
    :0r !date            " Insert date at top
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Backup files

Control how Vim creates backups:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Enable backups">
    ```vim
    :set backup              " Keep backup file
    :set nobackup            " Don't keep backup
    :set backupext=.bak      " Backup extension
    :set backupdir=~/.vim/backup  " Backup directory
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Swap files">
    ```vim
    :set swapfile            " Use swap files (default)
    :set noswapfile          " Don't use swap files
    :set directory=~/.vim/swap  " Swap file directory
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Patch mode">
    Keep original file:
    ```vim
    :set patchmode=.orig     " Keep original as .orig
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  Swap files help recover work after a crash. See `:help swap-file` for details.
</Note>

## File information

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Current file">
    ```vim
    Ctrl-G               " Show file info
    :file                " Show file name and status
    :f                   " Shorthand
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Change file name">
    ```vim
    :file newname.txt    " Rename buffer
    :saveas newname.txt  " Save as and continue editing
    :sav newname.txt     " Shorthand
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Read-only mode

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Open read-only">
    ```bash
    vim -R file.txt      # Open read-only
    view file.txt        # Same as vim -R
    vim -M file.txt      # Modifiable off
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="In Vim">
    ```vim
    :set readonly        " Make read-only
    :set noreadonly      " Make writable
    :w!                  " Force write
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
  Use `view` command instead of `vim -R` for easier typing.
</Tip>

## Auto-writing

Automatically save files:

```vim
:set autowrite           " Write when changing files
:set noautowrite         " Don't auto-write
:set autowriteall        " Write on more commands
```

<Note>
  With `autowrite`, Vim saves automatically when you use `:next`, `:prev`, etc.
</Note>

## Encryption

Encrypt files:

```vim
:X                   " Set encryption key
:set key=            " Clear encryption
```

<Warning>
  Vim's encryption is not very strong. Use external tools for sensitive data.
</Warning>

## Recovering files

After a crash:

```bash
vim -r                   # List swap files
vim -r file.txt          # Recover file
```

In Vim:
```vim
:recover file.txt        " Recover file
```

## File path completion

Use tab completion for file names:

```vim
:edit ~/doc<Tab>         " Complete path
:edit **/*test<Tab>      " Find in subdirectories
```

<Tip>
  Enable wildmenu for better completion:
  ```vim
  :set wildmenu
  :set wildmode=longest:full,full
  ```
</Tip>
