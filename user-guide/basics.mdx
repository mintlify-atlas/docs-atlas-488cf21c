# Vim basics and modes

Vim is a modal editor, which means it behaves differently depending on which mode you're in. Understanding modes is essential to using Vim effectively.

## Understanding modes

Vim has several modes, but the two most important ones are:

- **Normal mode**: For navigating and manipulating text
- **Insert mode**: For typing and inserting text

### Normal mode

When you start Vim, you're in Normal mode. In this mode, characters you type are commands, not text to be inserted.

<Tip>
  Press `Esc` to return to Normal mode from any other mode. If Vim beeps when you press `Esc`, you're already in Normal mode.
</Tip>

### Insert mode

To start typing text, you need to enter Insert mode. There are several ways to do this:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="i">
    Insert text before the cursor
    ```vim
    i
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="a">
    Insert text after the cursor (append)
    ```vim
    a
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="o">
    Open a new line below and enter Insert mode
    ```vim
    o
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="O">
    Open a new line above and enter Insert mode
    ```vim
    O
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

When you're in Insert mode, you'll see `-- INSERT --` at the bottom of the screen (if you have `set showmode` enabled).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Vim">
    Open a file with Vim:
    ```bash
    vim filename.txt
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Insert mode">
    Press `i` to enter Insert mode before the cursor
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Type your text">
    Type some text. It will appear in the file.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Return to Normal mode">
    Press `Esc` to return to Normal mode
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Basic editing commands

### Inserting text

Here are the main commands to enter Insert mode:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `i` | Insert before cursor |
| `I` | Insert at start of line (first non-blank character) |
| `a` | Append after cursor |
| `A` | Append at end of line |
| `o` | Open new line below |
| `O` | Open new line above |

### Deleting text

In Normal mode, you can delete text with these commands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `x` | Delete character under cursor |
| `X` | Delete character before cursor |
| `dd` | Delete entire line |
| `dw` | Delete word |
| `D` | Delete from cursor to end of line |

<Note>
  When you delete text in Vim, it's actually cut to a register, so you can paste it elsewhere.
</Note>

### Undo and redo

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `u` | Undo last change |
| `Ctrl-R` | Redo (undo the undo) |
| `U` | Undo all changes on current line |

## Saving and exiting

These commands are entered in Normal mode by typing a colon (`:`):

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Save">
    Write the file to disk:
    ```vim
    :write
    ```
    Or use the shorthand:
    ```vim
    :w
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Save and quit">
    Write the file and exit Vim:
    ```vim
    :wq
    ```
    Or use:
    ```vim
    ZZ
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Quit without saving">
    Exit without saving changes:
    ```vim
    :q!
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Just quit">
    Exit (will warn if there are unsaved changes):
    ```vim
    :q
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Getting help

Vim has extensive built-in help. To access it:

```vim
:help
```

For help on a specific topic:

```vim
:help i_CTRL-W
:help dd
:help 'textwidth'
```

<Tip>
  Use `Ctrl-]` to jump to a tag in the help, and `Ctrl-T` to jump back.
</Tip>

## Checking your mode

To see which mode you're in:

```vim
:set showmode
```

This will display the current mode at the bottom of the screen.

## Joining lines

To join two lines together:

```vim
J
```

This removes the line break and adds a space between the lines.

## Using counts

Many commands can be preceded by a count:

```vim
3dd    " Delete 3 lines
5x     " Delete 5 characters
2o     " Open 2 new lines
```

<Note>
  The count goes before the command. For example, `3dw` deletes three words.
</Note>

## Practice exercises

Try these exercises to get comfortable with Vim's modes:

1. Start Vim and enter some text
2. Delete a few words using `dw`
3. Undo your changes with `u`
4. Redo with `Ctrl-R`
5. Save the file with `:w`
6. Exit with `:q`

<Tip>
  The `vimtutor` program provides an interactive tutorial. Run it from your terminal:
  ```bash
  vimtutor
  ```
