## Overview

You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim. On Mac and Linux, a small version of Vim is pre-installed, but you'll want to install the full version for more features.

<Note>
  For the latest releases and source code, visit [vim.org/download](https://www.vim.org/download.php) or the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vim/vim).
</Note>

## Package manager installation

The easiest way to install Vim is using your system's package manager.

<CodeGroup>

```bash macOS (Homebrew)
brew install vim
```

```bash Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install vim
```

```bash Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install vim-enhanced
```

```bash Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S vim
```

```bash Alpine Linux
apk add vim
```

```bash FreeBSD
pkg install vim
```

</CodeGroup>

### macOS options

On macOS, you have several installation options:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Homebrew">
    Install the latest Vim using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
    
    ```bash
    brew install vim
    ```
    
    This provides a command-line version with full features.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="MacVim">
    For a native macOS GUI version, use [MacVim](https://macvim.org):
    
    ```bash
    brew install --cask macvim
    ```
    
    MacVim includes both GUI and command-line versions.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Windows installation

On Windows, you have two main installation methods:

### Self-installing executable

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the installer">
    Get the latest Windows installer from the [vim-win32-installer releases](https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run the installer">
    Double-click the `.exe` file and follow the prompts. If an existing installation is detected, you'll be offered to uninstall it first.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose installation directory">
    Select a directory like `C:\Program Files\vim` or `D:\vim`. Using a consistent location makes it easier to find your configuration files.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure options">
    The installer will let you:
    - Create desktop and Start menu shortcuts
    - Add "Edit with Vim" to the Windows Explorer context menu
    - Create batch files for running Vim from the command line
    - Set up your `_vimrc` configuration file
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Using zip archives

For manual installation using `.zip` files:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to installation directory">
    ```bash
    cd C:\
    ```
    
    Or choose another directory like `D:\editors`.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Extract the archives">
    ```bash
    unzip vim92w32.zip
    ```
    
    This creates a `vim\vim92` directory with all Vim files.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run the installer">
    ```bash
    cd vim\vim92
    install.exe
    ```
    
    Follow the prompts to configure your installation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Make sure to set the `VIM` environment variable if Vim can't find its runtime files. For example: `set VIM=C:\vim`
</Warning>

## Building from source

Building Vim from source gives you the most control over features and ensures you have the latest version.

### Linux/Unix

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install build dependencies">
    On Ubuntu/Debian:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install git make clang libtool-bin
    ```
    
    For GUI support, also install:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install libxt-dev libgtk-3-dev
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.git
    cd vim/src
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Build Vim">
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    
    This compiles Vim with default features.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test the build">
    ```bash
    make test
    ```
    
    Run tests to ensure everything works correctly.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install Vim">
    ```bash
    sudo make install
    ```
    
    This installs Vim to `/usr/local`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Build options

You can customize the build by editing the `Makefile` or running `configure` with options:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Python 3 support
# Uncomment in Makefile:
# CONF_OPT_PYTHON3 = --enable-python3interp
make reconfig
```

```bash GTK+ GUI
./configure --enable-gui=gtk3
make
```

```bash Motif GUI
./configure --enable-gui=motif
make
```

```bash Custom install prefix
./configure --prefix=/usr
make
```

</CodeGroup>

### macOS build

To build from source on macOS:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Xcode Command Line Tools">
    ```bash
    xcode-select --install
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Clone and build">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.git
    cd vim/src
    make
    sudo make install
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

For detailed macOS build instructions, see `src/INSTALLmac.txt` in the source tree.

## Verifying installation

After installation, verify Vim is working:

```bash
vim --version
```

This shows the version number and compiled features. Look for `+` symbols indicating enabled features:

- `+python3` - Python 3 support
- `+clipboard` - System clipboard integration
- `+syntax` - Syntax highlighting
- `+multi_byte` - Unicode support

## Getting help

Once Vim is installed, access the built-in documentation:

```vim
:help
```

Or start with the user manual:

```vim
:help user-manual
```
