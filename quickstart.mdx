## Starting Vim

To launch Vim, open your terminal and type:

```bash
vim
```

You'll see a welcome screen with the Vim version and some basic information. The cursor will be positioned at the top of an empty buffer.

<Tip>
To open Vim with a specific file, use `vim filename.txt`. If the file doesn't exist, Vim will create it when you save.
</Tip>

## Understanding modes

Vim is a modal editor, which means it has different modes for different tasks. This is what makes Vim powerful and efficient once you understand how modes work.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Normal mode">
    This is the default mode when you start Vim. In Normal mode, you navigate and manipulate text using keyboard commands. You can't type text directly in this mode.
    
    Press `Esc` to return to Normal mode from any other mode.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Insert mode">
    This is where you actually type and edit text, similar to a regular text editor. 
    
    Enter Insert mode by pressing `i` from Normal mode.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Visual mode">
    This mode lets you select blocks of text for copying, cutting, or other operations.
    
    Enter Visual mode by pressing `v` from Normal mode.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Command-line mode">
    This mode lets you execute commands like saving files, quitting Vim, or searching text.
    
    Enter Command-line mode by pressing `:` from Normal mode.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
The mode you're in is shown at the bottom left of the screen. If nothing is shown, you're in Normal mode.
</Note>

## Basic editing workflow

Let's walk through creating and editing your first file in Vim.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Vim with a file">
    Open your terminal and create a new file:
    
    ```bash
    vim hello.txt
    ```
    
    You'll see an empty buffer. Notice you're in Normal mode by default.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter insert mode">
    Press `i` to enter Insert mode. You should see `-- INSERT --` at the bottom of the screen.
    
    <Tip>
    There are several ways to enter Insert mode:
    - `i` — insert at cursor
    - `a` — append after cursor
    - `o` — open new line below
    - `O` — open new line above
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Type some text">
    Now you can type normally. Try typing:
    
    ```
    Hello, Vim!
    This is my first file.
    ```
    
    Press `Enter` to create new lines as you would in any text editor.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save and exit">
    First, press `Esc` to return to Normal mode. Then type:
    
    ```
    :wq
    ```
    
    Press `Enter` to execute the command. This writes (saves) the file and quits Vim.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If you make a mistake and want to quit without saving, use `:q!` instead of `:wq`.
</Note>

## Essential commands

Here are the most important commands to get you started with Vim:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `i` | Enter Insert mode at cursor |
| `a` | Enter Insert mode after cursor |
| `Esc` | Return to Normal mode |
| `:w` | Save (write) the file |
| `:q` | Quit Vim |
| `:wq` | Save and quit |
| `:q!` | Quit without saving |
| `h` `j` `k` `l` | Move left, down, up, right |
| `x` | Delete character under cursor |
| `dd` | Delete entire line |
| `u` | Undo last change |
| `Ctrl+r` | Redo |
| `yy` | Copy (yank) line |
| `p` | Paste after cursor |
| `/text` | Search for "text" |
| `n` | Jump to next search result |

<Tip>
Use `hjkl` instead of arrow keys to keep your hands on the home row. This might feel awkward at first, but it's much faster once you're used to it.
</Tip>
